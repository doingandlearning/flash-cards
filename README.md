# Flash Cards using Next.js Starter Tailwind

## Next Starter Tailwind

Shout out to Taylor Bryant for their excellent starter for Next and Tailwind. For me, it had exactly the right amount of configuration with no overt opinions. You can find it [here](https://github.com/taylorbryant/next-starter-tailwind).

## 50 React Projects

This repo was the output of a stream with the excellent [Colby Fayock](colbyfayock.com/). Colby has recently published a free ebook with 50 projects to build to help grow your development skills. You can get your own copy by signing up [here](https://50reactprojects.com).

This is one of the projects from the book.

## Flash Cards

This is a system to learn Futurama quotes - we got the data from [here](https://futuramaapi.herokuapp.com/) and moved that into a local JSON file.

We then used state and styling to make the card system.

## Next steps

I'm not sure we'll take this project any further but if we were we'd look at some of the following:

- Add a counter at the bottom
- Add animation with a "stack" of cards, a correct correct being discarded and an incorrect one going to the back
- Add a DB backend. Colby's book suggests using Firebase - my default tool for this would have been Mongo but I'd enjoy trying something new (to me) like Firebase
- Add the ability to add your own cards
- Add the ability to retain progress over time

## Stream

Colby and I worked on this during a live-stream. You can find it [here](https://youtu.be/5yIBAeGphTw).
